# MyZOE
MyZOE (MeineZOE) is an alternative app to view information about your ZOE.  
It will display status information about the mileage, the battery, the vehicle's position and maybe more stuff in the future.  
Plans are, to also provide a way to switch on pre-heating and to switch on/off charging.

Here are some example screens:
